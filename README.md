# Arduino-Heart

This project contains the source code for a 3d printed heart
I created containing three circles of LEDs pulsating to my pulse obtained using a [Pulse Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11574).

Each ring of LEDs is soldered in parallel and attached to a PWM enabled GPIO pin.
